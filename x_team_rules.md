# X-Team 21 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Groupchat for reminders/discussion, TODO.md for actual assigned jobs

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Use GitHub and Group me to keep track of and communicate what needs to be done
and what already has been done.


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
The team must have frequent, effective communication.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
The team must be willing to share its resources (Knowledge/Time).
