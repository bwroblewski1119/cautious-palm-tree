# X-Team 21 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

A TODO.md on the repository, and a groupchat for reminders.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Weekly groupchat checkins to see how everybody is progressing with their assigned tasks.

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
All will use GroupMe.
The team must have frequent, effective communication.
Commenting changes in GitHub when commiting edits to the group's projects.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
The team must be willing to share its resources (Knowledge/Time).
The team must not procrastinate before deadlines.
We'll be sure to remind each other to hold up our end of the work.
